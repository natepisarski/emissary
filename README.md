# Emissary state transfer mechanism
Applications are, by definition, stateful. Each line a processor executes depends on the one before it, and the state it's gotten into as a result. Possibly the most popular tool for dealing with state, `REST`, has been both misunderstood and widely adopted. With the advent of entire frameworks based on the concept of state, like React and Redux, making "state" a concrete thing has become more and more important.

Emissary is a way to manage remote state in **rust**. It lets you build up hierarchies for transmission, whether that be for a backend cache or a frontend state management mechanism, like Redux. If you were talking about a `department`, you might be able to add stateful objects, such as `department.employee`, `department.employee.name`. Emissary lets you build up these stateful hierarchies in just 100 lines of Rust.
